# About Me

Welcome! My name is **Kaichuan Qi (戚铠川)**. I am a graduate student in the math department at Penn State University, supervised by [Prof. Ping Xu](https://science.psu.edu/math/people/pxx2) and [Prof. Mathieu Stiénon](https://ulysses8791.github.io). 

Prior to Penn State, I obtained my master's degree from KU Leuven, under the guidance of [Prof. Marco Zambon](https://perswww.kuleuven.be/~u0096206/). And before that, I did my bachelor's in CUHK(Shenzhen).
